# qosf-task-1
Submission to QOSF's Task 1. Attempts to use QRAM to retrieve data in superposition.

QRAM now works, following the protocols set in [Q#'s primer](https://github.com/qsharp-community/qram/blob/master/docs/primer.pdf). 
Unfortunately, creating custom superpositions in order to retrieve a superposition of data has proven difficult, and I am still working on that. Once completed, the Oracle and Diffusion Operator for Grover's Algorithm can be implemented and completed.
